## 🛠️ Installation

To set up Chronio on your local machine, please follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have **Ruby** and **Rails** installed on your system.

- **Ruby**: [Install Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)
- **Rails**: [Install Rails](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/v5.0/getting_started.html)

### Setup

Choose one of the two setup methods below:

#### Option A: Nix Flake (Recommended for Nix users)

If you have Nix with flakes enabled, the easiest way to set up the development environment:

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/artemisln/chronio.git
   cd chronio
   ```

2. **Enter the development shell**

   ```bash
   nix develop
   ```

   This will automatically provide Ruby 3.3, PostgreSQL, Node.js, Yarn, ImageMagick, and all other dependencies.

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```

4. **Set up the database**

   ```bash
   rails db:create
   rails db:migrate
   rails db:seed # (optional)
   ```

4. **Start the server**

   ```bash
   bin/dev
   ```

#### Option B: Manual Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/artemisln/chronio.git
   cd chronio
   ```

2. **Install Prerequisites**

   - **Ruby 3.3.5** (use rbenv, rvm, or asdf)
   - **PostgreSQL 16** - Required for the `pg` gem
   - **Node.js 22** and **Yarn** - For Tailwind CSS
   - **ImageMagick** and **libvips** - For Active Storage image processing

3. **Configure your Ruby environment (Important!)**

   If you are not using a Ruby version manager like `rbenv` or `rvm`, you might encounter a permission error when installing gems (`Gem::FilePermissionError`). This happens because the system's default Ruby tries to install gems in a protected directory.

   To fix this, you can configure your system to install gems into your home directory. Run these commands:

   ```bash
   # For Bash users (default on many Linux systems)
   echo 'export GEM_HOME="$HOME/.gems"' >> ~/.bashrc
   echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.gems/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

   > **Note**: If you use a different shell like Zsh, replace `~/.bashrc` with `~/.zshrc`. After running the commands, you may need to restart your terminal.

   Next, install the `bundler` gem into this new location:
   ```bash
   gem install bundler
   ```

4. **Install dependencies**

   Make sure all necessary gems are installed by running:
   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```

5. **Set up the database**
   Run the following commands to create and migrate your database:
   ```bash
   rails db:create
   rails db:migrate
   rails db:seed # (optional, to populate with sample data)
   ```

6. **Start the server**
   Use the following command to start the development server:
   ```bash
   bin/dev
   ```

7. **Access your app**
     Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to see Chronio in action! 🎉
